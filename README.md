# Sandbox

This is going to be where I store all of the stuff I have made to ensure what I am learning sticks. And I think it will be nice to look back on this repo in the upcoming months when I am able to build entire dynamic websites and projects from scratch and see how far I've come. All of my projects that have been completely from scratch, or are substantial for one reason or another likely won't be in here.

Any random concept I learn about in a class or something that I just want to practice more I will throw in here. Hopefully seeing this repo expand all the time will be motivating. And when I look back it will be fun to see how far I've come. Also this a decent way for me to practice git. 

All the projects that are slightly bigger/me not just copying code directly from tutorials will be in dedicated folders in the sandbox. The Practice and Webpages folders contain a lot of small files that were mostly copied that I expanded upon slightly to help learn concepts. All other folders represent projects that I made with slight guidance from a tutorial/user stories (not just completely from scratch), but I still generated the code myself without copying directly. 

### Practice (formerly CSPrep)
Old files that are very small practice files that I most likely got from a course or youtube video. I like trying to make those tutorials as active as possible by trying to build along with them, then try and add functionality and test what I can do. Content mainly has to do with JS fundamentals, with an html file to see how it looks on a webpage in the console. After I took that I decided to go self-taught, but I still use this folder to practice Javascript fundamentals in an environment where I can play with the concepts and try to make the learning more.

### Webpages
Webpages are my forray into HTML/CSS. Any webpage I mess around with that isn't big enough for a dedicated folder, or are just the result of a freeCodeCamp module I've done or something go here. Mainly meant to make my learning more active and ensure I am practicing building real sites while I'm learning through a class.
