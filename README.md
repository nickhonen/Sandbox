# Sandbox

This is going to be where I store all of the stuff I have made to ensure what I am learning sticks.
Any random concept I learn about in a class or something that I just want to practice more I will throw in here. Hopefully seeing this repo expand all the time will be motivating. And when I look back it will be fun to see how far I've come. Also this a decent way for me to practice git.

CSPrep is from a prep course that I took when I wanted to do a bootcamp. Was mainly learning javascript fundamentals.

Webpages are my forray into HTML/CSS. Any webpage I mess around with that isn't big enough for a dedicated folder, or are just the result of a freeCodeCamp module I've done or something go here.
